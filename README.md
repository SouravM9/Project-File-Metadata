###    User stories:
1. One can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field  has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When submitting something, it will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

### Usage :
* Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.
